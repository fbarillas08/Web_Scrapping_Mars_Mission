          <h3>What is Humidity?</h3>
          <p>Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air.  Humidity is high when there is a lot of water vapor in the air.  The higher the humidity, the wetter it feels outside.  
            The measure of Humidity is a percentage and is technically known as relative humidity.  Relative humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air over the maximum amount of water vapor the air can hold at the same temperature.  This ratio is expressed as a percentage. 
            Colder air can handle less water vapor than warmer air.  
            According to the Mayo Clinic, the ideal relative humidity for health and comfort is somewhere between 30-50% humidity.
